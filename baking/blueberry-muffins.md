## Yield

12 large muffins

1. Preheat the oven to 375ºF.
2. Cream the butter and sugar.
3. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.
4. Alternate adding milk and dry ingredients (flour, salt, and baking powder).
5. Fold in the blueberries.
6. Line the muffin tin – I prefer [tulip liners](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08297PL5V).
7. Add muffin batter and sprinkle with sparkling sugar.
8. If you're at sea-level, bake for 30 mins. If you're a mile up, check it at 20 mins. Pull them when they're golden brown.
9. Let them rest on a wire rack until cool.
