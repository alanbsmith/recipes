# Doris' Christmas Molasses Cookies

## Notes

My mom made these when we were kids, and they were always a favorite. She got the recipe
 from her mom, Doris. These have always been a good source of comfort and
 nostalgia for me. They're great with hot coffee / tea or cold milk, and they
 make your house smell like Christmas. ðŸŽ„ðŸ˜€
