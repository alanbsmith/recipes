# Buttermilk Pancakes ðŸ¥ž

## Notes

This recipe is loosely adapted from [this NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018180-perfect-buttermilk-pancakes). They come out super fluffy. It also works great for waffles. I make my own buttermilk with whole milk and white vinegar, which I'll describe below.

These pancakes come out pretty thick, so they do well with fruit added. I personally enjoy adding blueberries or peaches and ground ginger.
