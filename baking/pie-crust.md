# Pie Crust

## Yield

One 9" (~23cm) pie crust — double if you want crust for the base and top

## Ingredients

- **1¼ cup (150g)** All-purpose flour
- **10 tbsp (~142g)** European or European-style butter cold, cut into medium-sized cubes
- **¼ tsp (0.25g)** Fine sea salt
- **2-4 tbsp (~30-60g)** Ice water, as needed

## Instructions

  1. Cut butter into cubes and chill. See [butter notes](#butter) below.
  
  2. Mix together flour and salt either by hand or in a food processor. See [mixing notes](#mixing) below.
  3. Add butter cubes and mix until chickpea-sized pieces form. 
  4. Add ice water one tablespoon at a time until the dough starts to come together. It should be moist but not wet.
  5. Turn onto a lightly-floured surface and gather into a ball.
  6. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and chill for an hour or up to two days.
  7. If you're making more than one crust, weigh the dough ball and divide evenly. Keep the other dough balls chilled while working with one.
  8. Roll the dough into a disk on a lightly floured surface. I prefer to roll in one direction, fold into thirds, and flip — lightly adding flour as needed. Keep an eye on [the temperature](#temperature) of the dough as you work it.
  9. Lay the dough in a pie pan and lightly press the to fit the pan. Chill until you're ready to fill the pie and put it in the oven.

## Notes

Pie dough is pretty straight-forward, but there's a bit of nuance in the process. Below are notes of things I've learned along the way.

### Temperature

Keeping the butter cold is really important for great crust. If the butter gets warm, the crust will still taste great, but will lose a bit of its flakiness and texture. When you're working with the dough, either by hand or the food processor, you're adding heat. If you're fast, you can make the dough all in one go and chill it after, but if you feel the dough getting warm while working with it, stick it in the fridge for fifteen to twenty minutes to re-chill it before resuming.

### Butter

Ideally, the butter should have a high percentage of butterfat (80%+). Some people prefer to combine lower-fat butter with lard or Crisco. Increasing the fat percentage will create a lighter, flakier crust, and butter will give it a richer flavor. European butter does this all for you, but you also can experiment with different fat blends.

Most recipes say to blend the butter until it's in pea-sized pieces, but you really want them to be larger (think chickpeas or lima beans) for a flaky crust.

### Mixing

You can either use a food processor or a mix by hand. I prefer to mix by hand to make sure I don't break up the butter too much, and I despise cleaning the food processor. If you're mixing by hand, you'll want to use a dough blender. I like [this one from OXO](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000QJE48O). If you're using a food processor, pulse lightly and keep an eye on the size of the butter pieces.
