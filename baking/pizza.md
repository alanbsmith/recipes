# Pizza Recipe [Deprecated]

## Notes

This dough is a same-day recipe. That said, the rising process is ~six hours,
 and proofing is an additional 45 min - 1 hour. So if you'd like to eat at 6pm,
 plan on starting around 10am.

This recipe is best enjoyed with a glass of üç∑ and listening to [The Essential Dean Martin](https://open.spotify.com/album/3bCD76GPTntFdGOT6KXgO3?si=VgVYvviJQBOAQslVoZQsoA)

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 400g all-purpose flour (~3¬º cups)
* 280g water at 90-95¬∞F (~1 cup and 2 tbsp)
* 8g salt (1¬Ω tsp)
* 0.5g yeast (‚Öõ tsp)
* 28g olive oil (2 tbsp)

### Toppings

* 15oz can pizza sauce (Muir Glen is great)
* 16oz bag of shredded mozzarella cheese
* other toppings *(your choice!)*

### Other Items

* Pizza stone, cast iron pizza pan, or a flat baking sheet
* Saran wrap
* Parchment paper
* Large bowl
* Additional flat baking sheet

## Instructions

### Prepping the Dough

* In a large bowl, mix the water and flour until just incorporated.
  * Let it set for 20-30 minutes
* Sprinkle the yeast and salt evenly over the mixture and knead by hand until well incorporated.
  * Be careful not to overwork the dough, which will make it tough and inflexible
* Drizzle olive oil over the dough and coat the sides of the bowl
  * This will help prevent the dough from sticking and add a little flavor
* Cover the bowl tightly with Saran wrap, and let it rise for 5-6 hours or until it doubles in volume
* While the dough is rising, cut your parchment paper to the size of your pan or pizza stone.
  * For me, this is about 15"

### Building Your Pizza

Once your dough has risen:

* On a well-floured surface, divide the dough in two
* Form each into proofing balls and place in a well-floured bowl
* Set the oven to 525¬∞F _with your pizza pan inside_
* Lightly flour your parchment paper
* When your dough has proofed (30-45mins) stretch it evenly about a 14" diameter
  * You'll know your dough has proofed when you can poke it with a well-floured finger and see it slowly come back
  * If it bounces back quickly, it needs more time
* Place the stretched dough on the floured parchment paper
* Spread the pizza sauce evenly on the dough, then add cheese, followed by your toppings.
* Once the oven is at temp, use a baking sheet to slide the pizza and parchment paper on to the pan in the oven.
* Let the pizza bake for 7-10 minutes. More toppings will take a little longer to cook.
* When fully cooked, slide the pizza and parchment paper back onto the baking sheet and  place somewhere to rest and cool for a few minutes.
* Close the oven door and wait a few minutes for the oven to reheat. Then repeat the process with the second pizza.
* Slice and enjoy!
