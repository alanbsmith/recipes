## Notes

A smash cocktail is a member of the julep family (mint, sugar, and spirit). Theyâ€™re typically shaken, not stirred and poured directly into a glass. This zero-proof smash is stirred because mixing in a shaker causes the ingredients to seize up as there is no alcohol to break down the ice.
